#+TITLE: Termlib: a minimalistic library for driving ANSI terminal emulators
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

* Terminal emulators
In the old times computers were huge [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer#History][mainframes]] accessed through dumb
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal][terminals]].  Since many ancient programs (for example [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi][vi]]) rely on the
functionality built into these terminals they are simulated on modern
(for some definition of modern) graphical systems as well.
* This project
There are multiple excellent libraries which aim to instrument these emulators.
So why are we rolling our own?
Most of the others:
- Try to cover all imaginable features.
- Take full control of our terminal emulator.
This library's goal is:
- Implement only the most often used functionality
- Be able to use them in an ad-hoc manner.  Only when needed, and
  otherwise keep out of the way.
** Features
- Change background / foreground color for printing.
- Clear the screen.
- Move cursor to arbitrary position.
- Move cursor relative to its actual position.
- Put a glyph to the actual cursor position.
** Sources
Some of the control sequences are described [[http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm][here]].
The relevant parts for us are:
- [[http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm#cursor][Cursor Control]]
- [[http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm#erase][Erasing Text]]
- [[http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm#colors][Set Display Attributes]]
* Things to watch out for
- Rows and columns are addressed starting from =1=.
- If the foreground color is changed and then the background color is
  changed as well the foreground color is not reset.
- Might be obvious but one of the mentors ran into it: =println=
  prints a newline â˜º.
- To see the bytestream output by your program use =hexdump=:
